My personal weblog. 

I am a twenty something programmer/technologist currently studying Computer
Science and artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh.

I enjoy working on things that help makes peoples life easier. 

I also enjoy cooking, recipes I cook on a regular basis can be found
[here](https://www.evernote.com/pub/dephraser/recipes).
